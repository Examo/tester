# About wedding-run
- This platform game was originally made for our wedding website. To be honest it's quite an addictive game. The player who scored the most, actually got a small present at the wedding :) His score was 90472 which is insane :)
- My intention with the publication of the source code is **to easy the life of those, who want to create similar games**. The Phaser community was a great help for we, with this project I would like to give something back. 
- This project can serve as an example project for you. You can study and observe how typical game building blocks are used
-  The code is structured in a self explanatory way, it is well commented. I advise to check out the repository and try to discover what's in there. It's amazing what you can achieve with a small footprint of code in **Phaser**!
## Game features
- Arcade physics, collision detection
- Use of sprites, tiles, advanced animation, text effects

- Main menu, credits, "game over" and high score screens
- User input through text boxes 
- Music and game sounds (ability to mute all sounds)
- Web service calls (get the list of TOP 10 player, save score)
- Achievements (e.g. "You have traveled 10.000 pixels")
- Multiple characters (groom, bride)
